EXPRESS - TODO CRUD
Create a TODO API server in express
Use any frontend you want, either some TODO frontend you created with React or API testing tools like Postman etc
If you use react frontend you will get clear idea about a full stack application
The todo server will have only 1 route. /
It will accept 4 different methods, GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
you can use a simple file based storage if you want.
alternatively you can also explore some embdedd databases like lowedb or leveldb or nedb. you will find enough examples for using those online. this is optional but it will make saving. retrieving etc very easy
